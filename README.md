Flight Tracking Exercise for iREMS

- I made a Flight tracking system where we can add, delete, and edit flights.
- The system contains a table that views the flights, and the buttons for the actions mentionedbefore.
- It is possible to filter the flights with a date/time interval by departure time.
- All the data stored in a H2 database.
